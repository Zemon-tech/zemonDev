# Zemon Community Frontend Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation

We've built a foundation for the Zemon Community frontend with the following components:

### 1. Layouts
- **PublicLayout**: For unauthenticated users, with a navigation bar and footer
- **AppLayout**: For authenticated users, with a sidebar and top navigation

### 2. Authentication
- Integrated Clerk for authentication
- Created sign-in and sign-up pages
- Implemented middleware for protecting routes
- Set up username-based routing for authenticated users

### 3. Pages
- Landing page with hero section, features, and ecosystem overview
- Dashboard page with stats, recent activity, and recommended next steps
- Placeholder pages for other sections (Forge, Crucible, Arena, etc.)

### 4. Theme & Styling
- Implemented light/dark mode toggle
- Used CSS variables for theming
- Applied consistent styling with rounded corners, shadows, and spacing
- Integrated with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance User Experience
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions between pages
- [ ] Implement error handling and error boundaries
- [ ] Create more interactive UI components (tooltips, modals, etc.)
- [ ] Add animations for page transitions

### 2. Develop Core Features
- [ ] **Forge**: Create learning paths, course listings, and lesson viewer
- [ ] **Crucible**: Implement problem listing, filtering, and solution submission
- [ ] **Arena**: Build competition listings, leaderboards, and submission system
- [ ] **Profile**: Develop user profile with achievements, stats, and customization

### 3. API Integration
- [ ] Set up API client with authentication headers
- [ ] Implement data fetching with React Query or SWR
- [ ] Create API hooks for common operations
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic

### 4. State Management
- [ ] Implement global state management for user preferences
- [ ] Set up context providers for feature-specific state
- [ ] Add local storage persistence for user settings

### 5. Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Write unit tests for core components
- [ ] Add integration tests for key user flows
- [ ] Optimize bundle size and code splitting
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring

### 6. Deployment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure environment variables for different environments
- [ ] Implement analytics and error tracking
- [ ] Create documentation for the codebase

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits a protected route (e.g., `/username/dashboard`)
2. Middleware checks if the user is authenticated
3. If not authenticated, redirect to sign-in page with return URL
4. After successful sign-in, redirect back to the original URL
5. If authenticated, render the protected route within the AppLayout

## Theme System

We're using CSS variables for theming, with light and dark mode support:

1. Theme variables are defined in `index.css`
2. The `ThemeContext` provider manages the current theme
3. The `ThemeToggle` component allows users to switch between themes
4. Theme preference is stored in localStorage and synced with system preference

## Responsive Design

The UI is fully responsive:
- Mobile: Collapsible sidebar, stacked layouts
- Tablet: Partially expanded sidebar, grid layouts
- Desktop: Full sidebar, multi-column layouts
