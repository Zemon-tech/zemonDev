# Arena Frontend Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the Arena frontend features, a Discord-like community platform with real-time chat, project showcase, and hackathon features.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup ✅

### API Service Layer
Created `frontend/src/services/api.service.ts` to handle communication with the backend:
- Implemented authentication header handling
- Added methods for fetching channels and messages
- Added methods for project showcase and hackathon features

### Socket.IO Service
Created `frontend/src/services/socket.service.ts` for real-time communication:
- Implemented connection management with authentication
- Added reconnection logic
- Created methods for socket access and status checking

## Phase 2: React Hooks for State Management ✅

### Arena Socket Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaSocket.ts`:
- Manages socket connection lifecycle
- Handles authentication with Clerk
- Provides socket instance and connection status

### Arena Channels Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaChannels.ts`:
- Fetches available channels from the API
- Organizes channels by group
- Provides loading and error states

### Real-time Chat Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaChat.ts`:
- Manages real-time messaging for a specific channel
- Handles message history loading
- Implements typing indicators
- Provides message sending functionality
- Fixed bug where messages.map would fail if the backend response was not an array

### Error Handling
Created `frontend/src/components/arena/ArenaErrorBoundary.tsx`:
- Catches and displays errors in Arena components
- Provides a user-friendly error message
- Offers a refresh button to recover from errors
- Improved error handling for chat and socket failures

## Phase 3: Transform Existing Components ✅

### ChatChannel Component
Updated `frontend/src/components/arena/ChatChannel.tsx`:
- Integrated with real-time chat hook
- Implemented message display with proper formatting
- Added typing indicators
- Created loading and error states
- Implemented message input with typing detection
- Typing indicator now shows Clerk username (e.g., 'user_A is typing...')
- Improved error and loading states

### ArenaPage Component
Updated `frontend/src/pages/ArenaPage.tsx`:
- Added error boundary wrapper
- Updated channel rendering to pass proper props to ChatChannel
- Added debug logging for authentication and socket events during development

### ShowcaseChannel Component
Updated `frontend/src/components/arena/ShowcaseChannel.tsx`:
- Integrated with useArenaShowcase hook
- Implemented real project data display
- Added upvoting functionality
- Created loading and error states
- Implemented responsive UI for different content types

### HackathonChannel Component
Updated `frontend/src/components/arena/HackathonChannel.tsx`:
- Integrated with useArenaHackathon hook
- Implemented real hackathon data display
- Added dynamic leaderboard
- Created loading and error states
- Added conditional rendering based on hackathon status

### AnnouncementsChannel Component
Updated `frontend/src/components/arena/AnnouncementsChannel.tsx`:
- Integrated with useArenaChat hook in read-only mode
- Implemented announcement formatting with title extraction
- Added pinned announcements feature
- Created admin-only posting interface
- Implemented responsive UI for different announcement types

### DirectMessageChannel Component
Updated `frontend/src/components/arena/DirectMessageChannel.tsx`:
- Integrated with useArenaChat hook for private messaging
- Implemented dynamic channel ID generation based on recipient
- Added typing indicators
- Created loading and error states
- Implemented responsive UI for direct messaging

## Phase 4: Additional Features Implementation ✅

### Project Showcase Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaShowcase.ts`:
- Fetches projects from the showcase API
- Implements upvoting functionality
- Manages loading and error states

### Hackathon Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaHackathon.ts`:
- Fetches current hackathon data
- Provides access to hackathon details and leaderboard
- Manages loading and error states

### Offline Handling
Implemented across all components:
- Added connection status indicators
- Created error states for network failures
- Added retry functionality for failed requests

### Progressive Loading
Implemented across all components:
- Added loading states with spinners
- Implemented skeleton loading for content
- Added graceful degradation for unavailable features

## Bug Fixes & Improvements (2024-07)
- Fixed Clerk authentication issues causing 401 errors on Arena page.
- Fixed socket authentication to use MongoDB user _id instead of Clerk userId, resolving BSON errors.
- Updated backend and frontend to use Clerk username (not fullName) for chat message usernames.
- Updated backend and frontend to show Clerk username in typing indicator events.
- Improved error boundaries and error handling for chat and socket failures.
- Improved loading and error states for chat and channel components.
- Added debug logging for authentication and socket events during development.
- Note: After adding the username field to the user model, a backfill/migration is required for existing users to populate their Clerk usernames.

## Technical Decisions

### State Management
- Using React hooks for local state management
- Leveraging useEffect for data fetching and socket events
- Using useCallback for memoized event handlers

### Error Handling
- Implemented error boundaries for component-level error catching
- Added error states in hooks for API-level errors
- Created user-friendly error messages and recovery options

### Performance Considerations
- Implemented proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Used memoization for callback functions
- Added typing indicator debounce to reduce network traffic
- Optimized rendering with conditional component display

## Next Steps

### Future Enhancements
- Add offline message queuing for better network resilience
- Implement message reactions and emoji support
- Add file upload functionality for chat and showcase
- Implement user profile viewing and management
- Add notification system for mentions and direct messages

### Testing
- Implement unit tests for hooks and components
- Add integration tests for real-time functionality
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Validate accessibility compliance

The Arena frontend implementation is now complete with all core functionality working as expected. The platform provides a Discord-like experience with real-time chat, project showcase, and hackathon features, all integrated with the backend API and Socket.IO for real-time updates.
