# Arena Frontend Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of the Arena frontend features, a Discord-like community platform with real-time chat, project showcase, and hackathon features.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup ✅

### API Service Layer
Created `frontend/src/services/api.service.ts` to handle communication with the backend:
- Implemented authentication header handling
- Added methods for fetching channels and messages
- Added methods for project showcase and hackathon features

### Socket.IO Service
Created `frontend/src/services/socket.service.ts` for real-time communication:
- Implemented connection management with authentication
- Added reconnection logic
- Created methods for socket access and status checking

## Phase 2: React Hooks for State Management ✅

### Arena Socket Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaSocket.ts`:
- Manages socket connection lifecycle
- Handles authentication with Clerk
- Provides socket instance and connection status

### Arena Channels Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaChannels.ts`:
- Fetches available channels from the API
- Organizes channels by group
- Provides loading and error states

### Real-time Chat Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaChat.ts`:
- Manages real-time messaging for a specific channel
- Handles message history loading
- Implements typing indicators
- Provides message sending functionality

### Error Handling
Created `frontend/src/components/arena/ArenaErrorBoundary.tsx`:
- Catches and displays errors in Arena components
- Provides a user-friendly error message
- Offers a refresh button to recover from errors

## Phase 4: Additional Features Implementation (Partial) ✅

### Project Showcase Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaShowcase.ts`:
- Fetches projects from the showcase API
- Implements upvoting functionality
- Manages loading and error states

### Hackathon Hook
Created `frontend/src/hooks/useArenaHackathon.ts`:
- Fetches current hackathon data
- Provides access to hackathon details and leaderboard
- Manages loading and error states

## Phase 3: Transform Existing Components (In Progress)

### ChatChannel Component
Updated `frontend/src/components/arena/ChatChannel.tsx`:
- Integrated with real-time chat hook
- Implemented message display with proper formatting
- Added typing indicators
- Created loading and error states
- Implemented message input with typing detection

### ArenaPage Component
Updated `frontend/src/pages/ArenaPage.tsx`:
- Added error boundary wrapper
- Updated channel rendering to pass proper props to ChatChannel

## Next Steps

### Remaining Components to Update
- ShowcaseChannel: Integrate with useArenaShowcase hook
- HackathonChannel: Integrate with useArenaHackathon hook
- AnnouncementsChannel: Implement read-only chat functionality
- DirectMessageChannel: Implement private messaging

### Additional Features
- Implement offline message queuing
- Add connection status indicators
- Create optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Add progressive loading for images and content

## Technical Decisions

### State Management
- Using React hooks for local state management
- Leveraging useEffect for data fetching and socket events
- Using useCallback for memoized event handlers

### Error Handling
- Implemented error boundaries for component-level error catching
- Added error states in hooks for API-level errors
- Created user-friendly error messages and recovery options

### Performance Considerations
- Implemented proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Used memoization for callback functions
- Added typing indicator debounce to reduce network traffic
