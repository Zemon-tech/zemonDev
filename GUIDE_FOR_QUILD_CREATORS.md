## üè∑Ô∏è Understanding Problem Categories

### The 8 Main Categories

Quild has **8 predefined categories** that users can browse:

1. **Algorithms** - Data structures, sorting, searching, and algorithmic thinking
2. **System Design** - Scalable architectures, distributed systems, and design patterns
3. **Web Development** - Frontend, backend, APIs, and modern web technologies
4. **Mobile Development** - iOS, Android, React Native, and mobile app challenges
5. **Data Science** - Machine learning, data analysis, and statistical modeling
6. **DevOps** - CI/CD, cloud infrastructure, and deployment strategies
7. **Frontend** - React, Vue, Angular, and modern UI/UX challenges
8. **Backend** - Node.js, Python, Java, and server-side development

### How Categories Work

- **Categories are visual groupings** for users to browse problems
- **A problem can appear in multiple categories** based on its tags
- **Categories show problem counts** to help users understand what's available
- **Categories have unique colors and icons** for easy identification

## üè∑Ô∏è Tag System Explained

### What Are Tags?

Tags are **keywords that describe your problem** and determine which categories it appears in. Think of tags as the "DNA" of your problem that tells the system where to display it.

### Core Tag Categories

#### **Technology Tags**
- `frontend` - Frontend development problems
- `backend` - Backend development problems
- `api` - API design and development
- `database` - Database design and optimization
- `mobile` - Mobile app development
- `devops` - Infrastructure and deployment
- `security` - Security-focused challenges

#### **Concept Tags**
- `scaling` - Scalability and performance
- `realtime` - Real-time systems and communication
- `distributed` - Distributed systems and microservices
- `algorithms` - Algorithmic problem solving
- `data-analysis` - Data processing and analysis
- `machine-learning` - ML and AI challenges
- `ui-ux` - User interface and experience design

#### **Domain Tags**
- `ecommerce` - E-commerce and shopping platforms
- `social-media` - Social networking features
- `gaming` - Game development challenges
- `finance` - Financial and payment systems
- `healthcare` - Healthcare and medical applications
- `education` - Educational technology platforms

### Tag Best Practices

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Use 3-5 relevant tags per problem
- Include both technology and concept tags
- Be specific but not overly granular
- Consider what users would search for

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Use too many tags (more than 5)
- Use vague or generic tags
- Use tags that don't match the problem content
- Use tags just to get more category exposure

## üéØ How to Create a Problem

### Step 1: Choose Your Problem Type

**Real-World Problems** (Recommended)
- Problems based on actual industry challenges
- Scenarios that developers face in their jobs
- Problems that teach practical skills

**Interview-Style Problems**
- Algorithmic challenges similar to technical interviews
- System design questions for senior positions
- Coding problems with specific constraints

**Learning-Focused Problems**
- Problems designed to teach specific concepts
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Problems with clear learning objectives

### Step 2: Structure Your Problem

**Essential Components:**

1. **Title** - Clear, descriptive, and engaging
2. **Description** - Comprehensive problem statement
3. **Requirements** - What the solution should accomplish
4. **Constraints** - Limitations and boundaries
5. **Expected Outcome** - What success looks like
6. **Hints** - Helpful guidance without giving away the solution
7. **Learning Objectives** - What users will learn
8. **Estimated Time** - How long it should take

### Step 3: Assign Appropriate Tags

**Tag Selection Process:**

1. **Identify the primary technology** (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `api`)
2. **Consider the main concept** (e.g., `scaling`, `security`, `realtime`)
3. **Think about the domain** (e.g., `ecommerce`, `social-media`)
4. **Add relevant skill tags** (e.g., `algorithms`, `data-analysis`)

### Step 4: Set Difficulty Level

**Difficulty Guidelines:**

- **Easy** - 30-60 minutes, basic concepts, straightforward implementation
- **Medium** - 1-3 hours, moderate complexity, some advanced concepts
- **Hard** - 3-6 hours, complex requirements, multiple technologies
- **Expert** - 6+ hours, enterprise-level challenges, deep technical knowledge

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### Problem Creation Best Practices

#### **1. Start with Real-World Scenarios**
- Base problems on actual industry challenges
- Use realistic constraints and requirements
- Include edge cases that developers actually face

#### **2. Provide Clear Context**
- Explain the business problem, not just the technical solution
- Include user personas and their needs
- Describe the impact of the solution

#### **3. Set Appropriate Scope**
- Don't make problems too broad or too narrow
- Focus on specific skills or technologies
- Balance complexity with achievability

#### **4. Include Learning Objectives**
- Clearly state what users will learn
- Connect to real-world applications
- Provide resources for further learning

#### **5. Use Progressive Difficulty**
- Start with basic requirements
- Add complexity through constraints
- Provide optional advanced features

### Tag Selection Best Practices

#### **1. Be Specific but Not Overly Granular**
- Use tags that users would actually search for
- Avoid overly technical or obscure terms
- Consider what skills the problem teaches

#### **2. Balance Technology and Concepts**
- Include both technology tags (e.g., `react`) and concept tags (e.g., `state-management`)
- Don't focus only on one aspect
- Consider the full scope of the problem

#### **3. Think About User Intent**
- What would someone search for to find this problem?
- What skills are they trying to develop?
- What technologies are they learning?

#### **4. Use Consistent Tagging**
- Follow established tag conventions
- Use existing tags when possible

#### **2. Irrelevant Tags**
- ‚ùå Adding `machine-learning` to a simple CRUD app
- ‚úÖ Using tags that actually relate to the problem content

#### **3. Inconsistent Tagging**
- ‚ùå Using different tags for similar problems
- ‚úÖ Following consistent tagging conventions

#### **4. Missing Core Tags**
- ‚ùå Forgetting to tag the primary technology or concept
- ‚úÖ Always including the main technology and primary concept
