# Clock Skew Tolerance & Token Refresh Strategy Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan addresses the JWT token verification failures caused by clock skew between Clerk's servers and our backend, and implements a robust token refresh strategy to prevent authentication issues.

## Problem Analysis

### Current Issues
1. **Clock Skew**: JWT tokens issued by Clerk are 10 seconds ahead of our server time
2. **Token Verification Failures**: `_TokenVerificationError: JWT issued at date claim (iat) is in the future`
3. **Socket Authentication Failures**: Real-time connections failing due to token verification errors
4. **No Token Refresh Strategy**: Frontend doesn't proactively refresh tokens before expiration

### Impact
- Socket connections failing intermittently
- Poor user experience with real-time features
- Potential authentication timeouts during long sessions
